"Documenting and simply sharing what I'm learning on my way."

This repository is a documentationa as I share my journey and daily learning through practices,
intending to connect with people on this platform to get feedback loops in order for improvements
that will help me learn more efficiently and effectively.
I'm not a master or expert, just a student learning and sharing my works with others along the way.

Lastly, it will serve as an archive of my learning that I can always look back to
see how far I've come, and remind myself of lessons that I;ve learnt but forgot.
